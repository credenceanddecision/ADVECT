# ImpactATTAnalyzer
ImpactATTAnalyzer facilitates the estimation of Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT) using the Conditional Independence Assumption (CIA), tailored for marketing campaign data.

## Example scenario

A national wine merchant aims to enhance wine club memberships by encouraging households to purchase a minimum of 12 bottles via a targeted advertising campaign. The "ImpactATTAnalyzer" tool is utilized to design and evaluate this campaign, focusing on identifying households most likely to respond based on variables like wine consumption level, purchase history, and preferences. By conducting power analysis and estimating the Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT) using the Conditional Independence Assumption (CIA), the merchant can efficiently allocate resources, target the campaign more effectively, and measure its impact, optimizing marketing strategies for increased engagement and sales.
